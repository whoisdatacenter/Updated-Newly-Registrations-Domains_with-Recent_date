Familiarize Yourself with the Project: Before contributing, please take some time to go through the existing list of domains in our repository. This will give you an idea of what has already been added and what might still be needed.


 •Check for Open Issues: Look through the open issues to see if there are any that you can address. If you find one, comment that you're working on it to avoid duplicate efforts.

 •Create a New Issue: If you have a new list of domains or improvements, start by creating a new issue. Clearly describe your proposed contribution, how it adds value, and any other relevant details.

 •Fork the Repository: Make a fork of the repository on GitHub and work on your proposed changes in your fork.

 •Adhere to Data Format Guidelines: Ensure that the domains you're adding follow the standardized format used in the repository. This typically involves consistency in domain naming, categorization, and any associated metadata.

 •Create a Pull Request: Once you have completed your addition or improvement, create a pull request to the main repository. In your pull request, reference the issue it addresses.

 • For Review: The repository maintainers will review your pull request. Be open to feedback and make necessary changes if requested.
